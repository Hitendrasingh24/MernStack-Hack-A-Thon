# Enhanced Text Extractor Tool

##Problem Statement: 
The problem is to develop an Enhanced Text Extraction and Enrichment tool that 
allows users to upload files, extract text from various formats such as PDF, and 
enrich the extracted data using external APIs like OpenAI or Gemini. The tool should 
provide a user-friendly interface for seamless file uploads, data display, and 
interactive text processing. 

##Objective: 
• Text Extraction: Implement text extraction functionality to extract text from 
uploaded files, with support for various formats including PDF. 
• Data Enrichment: Utilize external APIs like OpenAI or Gemini to enrich extracted 
text data with additional insights or context. 
• API Development: Develop RESTful API routes for handling file uploads, text 
extraction, and data enrichment, ensuring smooth communication between the 
frontend and backend. 
• Interactive UI: Create an engaging and responsive user interface that allows 
seamless file uploads, displays processed results, and provides customization 
options for text extraction and enrichment. 
• Error Handling: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully 
manage unexpected errors during file uploads, text extraction, and data enrichment 
processes. 
• User Authentication: Implement user authentication and authorization 
mechanisms to secure access to the application and protect user data. 

##Client-side Code Description: 
The frontend part of the Coding Blocks-Enhanced Text Extractor Tool project is 
designed to provide a seamless and intuitive user experience. Here's a detailed 
description of the frontend components and technologies used: 
1. React Components: The frontend is built using React, a popular JavaScript 
library for building user interfaces. Various components are created to manage 
different parts of the application, such as the home page, login page, signup page, 
and the PDF upload section. 
2. Home Page: The home page serves as the entry point for users. It includes a 
PDF upload section where users can easily upload their PDF files for text extraction 
and enrichment. This section is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, guiding 
users through the upload process. 
3. Login and Signup Pages: To enhance user interaction and provide personalized 
experiences, the project includes login and signup pages. Users can create 
accounts or log in to access additional features, such as saving preferences or 
viewing past extractions. 
4. Routing with react-router-dom: React Router is used for client-side routing.

##Server-side Description:
The server-side functionalities of the Extract and Enrich Text Tool are designed to 
provide a robust infrastructure for text extraction, enrichment, and user interaction. 
The backend architecture encompasses key components such as Node.js for serverside JavaScript execution, Express.js for API development, MongoDB for data 
storage, and integration with external APIs for data enrichment. Authentication, 
middleware handling, error management, and optimization techniques are also 
integral parts of the backend system. Let's delve deeper into each functionality to 
understand how the backend facilitates seamless text processing and user 
interactions.
The backend of the Coding Blocks-Enhanced Text Extractor Tool project is a critical 
component responsible for handling data processing, authentication, and 
communication with external APIs. Here's a detailed description of the backend 
components and technologies used: 
1. Node.js Backend: The backend is developed using Node.js, a versatile JavaScript runtime environment that allows for efficient server-side programming.
2. MongoDB for Database Management: MongoDB is used as the database 
management system to store and retrieve data efficiently. Its NoSQL documentoriented database model offers flexibility and scalability. 
3. Route Handling for Authentication: Backend routes are configured to manage 
user authentication, including login, signup, and user session management. 
Authentication mechanisms such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) may be implemented 
for secure user authentication and authorization. 
4. PDF Extraction with Multer and pdf-parser: For PDF extraction, Multer 
middleware is used to handle file uploads and store temporary data in buffers. The 
pdf-parser module is then utilized to extract text content from uploaded PDF files, 
enabling text processing and analysis. 
5. Data Enrichment with Gemini API: The Gemini API is integrated into the 
backend to enrich extracted data with additional insights or context and enhancing 
the quality and relevance of extracted text data.
